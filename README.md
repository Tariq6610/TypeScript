# TypeScript Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of TypeScript projects created during my course and other personal projects. Each project is organized into its own folder within the repository.



## Projects 
 - ###  Project00
This is my first TypeScript project. As every programming journey starts with the 'hello world!' program, this is my 'hello world' project. It consists of two files: Main.ts and main.js. Here, I have created the Main.ts file and compiled it to main.js.

 - ### Step00_helloWorld
This is my second program. It is also a 'hello world' program, but in this program, I have created JSON configuration and package files, as well as a node_modules directory. Additionally, I have created a .gitignore file where I have included these extra files.

 - ### project_Q45
This is a project assigned by our teachers to be completed at our own pace. It is also part of the 100 Days of Code challenge, where our teacher instructed us to complete it within the first 15 days. Alhamdulillah, I have completed it on time. This project consists of 45 questions, which I have distributed across four separate files. The first file contains 10 questions, the second file contains another 10, and so on.

## Future Projects
I plan to continue adding more TypeScript projects to this repository as I progress in my course and explore new ideas. Stay tuned for updates!
